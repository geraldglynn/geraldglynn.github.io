WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:11.670
Gerald Glynn: And Okay, so people who do have laptops with working webcams if you can turn on your webcam just like and see that would be great.

2
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:30.840
Gerald Glynn: And and last week we had three volunteers for keeping an eye on the chat and then kind of being my eyes on the ground, so, if I can have two volunteers for keeping on the trash can you give me a thumbs up emoji.

3
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.730
Lauren Coffey: yeah I can do this.

4
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.200
Gerald Glynn: who's that loan.

5
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.150
Gerald Glynn: right then.

6
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.170
Lauren Coffey: Just remember.

7
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.480
Gerald Glynn: A second volunteer.

8
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.440
Gerald Glynn: Charlie will you be you keep an eye on the chat for me I don't know if you did it before.

9
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.650
Charlie Gallagher: yeah we'll look.

10
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.820
Gerald Glynn: phil thanks Jerry.

11
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.010
Gerald Glynn: And then.

12
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.090
Gerald Glynn: The other job, which is the last just my eyes on the ground so it's just to confirm that you can see em.

13
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:32.220
Gerald Glynn: and whatever i'm doing email, would you be up for reminders in the Grand just means every now and again, and just kind of confirm i'm sharing correctly, you can read the white boy correctly, rather than asking the class.

14
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.780
Emer McGovern: yeah yeah.

15
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.440
Gerald Glynn: Great thanks.

16
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.020
Emer McGovern: So you're my eyes.

17
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.960
Were.

18
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.690
Gerald Glynn: So.

19
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.470
tight.

20
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.290
Gerald Glynn: So Amer Can you see.

21
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.350
Gerald Glynn: Mostly black vs code opened and then something it says assignment one.

22
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.760
Emer McGovern: yeah again.

23
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:38.130
Gerald Glynn: Good alright, so the first assignment it's worked at 10 mike's as 10% of the grade the today's is Friday the 18th so that's two weeks from tomorrow, and I should put a time on those.

24
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.220
Gerald Glynn: vm.

25
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:56.790
Gerald Glynn: Is today's so build a static website, consisting of five pages, most of the sightings should be done using external CSS so now embedded and not in line.

26
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:08.370
Gerald Glynn: And if you want to do some in line and embedded CSS that's fine post, the bulk of the styling should be an external CSS and the content should include.

27
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:31.230
Gerald Glynn: Any elements that we and i've been covering feel free to research and add your own elements so far we've covered and images we've covered and we haven't covered list and tables, so I look at that today and we didn't I don't think we covered links and.

28
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.950
Gerald Glynn: and probably also your website should have a contact form.

29
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:52.710
Gerald Glynn: And typically when we have a contact form we need the the fields that were filled out to be sent, and process summer so for this assignment.

30
00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:11.130
Gerald Glynn: we're focusing only on front end technologies so this assignment is html and CSS only, and so, in order to actually have a functional contact form at there is a service called forum spree.

31
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:24.690
Gerald Glynn: So on that you, you can define the fields within your form, and you can send it to that service, and that will take care of the back end aspect from froze.

32
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:41.280
Gerald Glynn: A i've used it before and it's very handy for this, and this type of work, and I want you to I want you to use this over other systems like mailchimp are and.

33
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.360
Gerald Glynn: Other examples are there mailchimp is kind of like the usual go to mainly because mailchimp will provide you with an embedded.

34
00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:12.990
Gerald Glynn: piece of code to put on your website that a generation and you don't have control over the contact form and also it's a little bit too easy and and you won't be learning how to build a contact form and then the last step is host your website on github pages so and.

35
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.340
Gerald Glynn: i'm going to put finally.

36
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.760
Gerald Glynn: Just so it's here.

37
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.570
And let's.

38
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.320
Lauren Coffey: i'm Gerry.

39
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.820
Lauren Coffey: You Jamie just said in the chat there Friday is actually the.

40
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.330
Gerald Glynn: 19th okay.

41
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.070
Gerald Glynn: Thank you Jamie so i'm going to amend my slides.

42
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.400
Gerald Glynn: And and Jamie corrected the.

43
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:26.670
Gerald Glynn: So, because this is a web development course i'm delivering as much of the course as possible through web development technologies, what this does is, you can see, when we talk about web development it doesn't have to be just websites html we can extend the tools that we're using.

44
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:45.840
Gerald Glynn: To and for other needs that we might have in this case I need to develop I need to deliver a web development course so i'm using those tools so and where, can you find everything that I just am wrote here, so if you go to.

45
00:06:47.250 --> 00:07:00.030
Gerald Glynn: If you go to get up in the Houston school, you should only see a few repos here, and one of them is called web development.

46
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:19.740
Gerald Glynn: So I asked that everyone open and that repository and navigate through is for me it's it's it's very important that everyone has access to this and they're able to navigate around English so, for example, what we just looked at, there was and.

47
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:29.010
Gerald Glynn: A markdown file under assignments, so if you click on assignments and click on as your one html CSS.

48
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:41.790
Gerald Glynn: you'll see just what I wrote there and it says the 19th and everything updated so this is the, this is the list of this is the i'll ever what the assignment is for.

49
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:54.870
Gerald Glynn: I need to get the rubrics and finalized, and by l because they're and they're necessary for us to live in content that each as it has a rubric so I have a rubric.

50
00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:05.760
Gerald Glynn: For this, and for those who don't know rubric it's just a matrix that will give you a clear indication of where points are being assigned within the assignment.

51
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:19.230
Gerald Glynn: And so you know where to focus your efforts and then it's very clear, you know, in order to pass the assignment, you must have the following, and then, in order to cash and.

52
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:30.450
Gerald Glynn: Like and like a two one or two to speak that language, this is what the expectations are and then, if you want to aim for em an honors.

53
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:45.780
Gerald Glynn: And to get 70 Plus, then this is wash would be indicated so that's that and follow that up and that'll be underneath there'll be a rubrics matrix underneath and the assignment on this page.

54
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:56.370
Gerald Glynn: So, and any questions on accessing this repository be able to view the assignments, and the assignment ask.

55
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:08.310
Gerald Glynn: And Okay, and then what rather than.

56
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:18.420
Gerald Glynn: Because of recording the sessions, and you can watch back and then what i'm going to focus these sessions are covering everything that you need.

57
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:34.650
Gerald Glynn: For the assignment so i'll be almost am pretty much doing like a basic skeleton of the assignment and try this class and then every now and again, we might just stop.

58
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:54.660
Gerald Glynn: And zoom in on html elements that we've introduced and then we'll em would break that down and garner better understanding of you know a bit of theory on that and maybe look up some online and documentation to help us support dash.

59
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.440
Gerald Glynn: Okay, any questions.

60
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:09.420
Guoyang: Derek yep, so we need beard have five web page all five website.

61
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:18.870
Gerald Glynn: Oh yeah so it's, so this is this is very good distinction doing so it's one website that has five individual web pages.

62
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:32.580
Gerald Glynn: So we discussed this and in our first class of you know what is a website and a website is at its lowest level is a collection of web pages.

63
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.570
Gerald Glynn: And ways for us to move between those web pages, so you might be used to going to a website, we will have a homepage, you will have a contact page web page okay okay got it.

64
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:59.940
Gerald Glynn: and any any questions like this, a please bring them up and sometimes I might part of your question, just to say we're going to address that later on in the in the class and then.

65
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:18.390
Gerald Glynn: If I if I won't address the question in the class what i'm going to do is put this on our kind of in and putting together a can ban Board of questions so he so.

66
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:37.050
Gerald Glynn: For example, there we brought up someone asked in the first class what is ecmo script and I didn't put an answer on that was at Daniel went off and got the actual what the what the acronym and so forth, and I should probably update.

67
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.970
That.

68
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:59.730
Gerald Glynn: So if if if if a question comes up and and either I think it's too big a question to answer within today's session.

69
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:20.820
Gerald Glynn: And i'll put it on this can man and you should have access to this yourselves and for now let's just treat it as a like a to do list for me to make sure i'm not leaving any questions on answered moving forward and m.

70
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:33.690
Gerald Glynn: And the other I might I might put a question I might determine that a question is out of the scope of the class and because I know i'm going to answer be answering it in a in a later class.

71
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.850
Gerald Glynn: Like good.

72
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:50.340
Gerald Glynn: And if anyone has suggest this is just a process i'm proposing for us to add to help us work together, while we're delivering courses online if anyone has suggestions.

73
00:12:52.020 --> 00:13:00.720
Gerald Glynn: for things that they they feel don't work or it's it's difficult for them, please bring them to me in the class or directly and through teams josh.

74
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:13.590
Gerald Glynn: If you have suggestions on how this could be improved i'm all ears and we use this has got a combat board and and it's simply just volumes people might have used something like trial.

75
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.640
Lauren Coffey: and

76
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:27.510
Gerald Glynn: error, which is this type of system, and so we I use this all the time at work, but I haven't used it in this kind of context of teaching so i'm very open to suggestions of what you feel is working and not working.

77
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.550
Gerald Glynn: And okay before we get started i'm just going to turn the heat on here.

78
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.490
Gerald Glynn: And also.

79
00:13:51.570 --> 00:14:10.110
Gerald Glynn: And content that we had discussed during the class and the notes I keep on the whiteboard and photograph and i'm distilling those into em alone my 10 usually per class and sometimes there might be.

80
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:24.840
Gerald Glynn: As slides that overlaps two classes, but we would break it out by m what we're focusing on further josh and so, for example, if you go into this repo under slides.

81
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:35.670
Gerald Glynn: And you'll see the first one, where basics, so this is what we discussed the first, and this is what we discussed in the first two classes and.

82
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.840
Gerald Glynn: No static.

83
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:52.110
Gerald Glynn: slides that will be presented to you and then and any additions that came up in the class, so you should, and this should render correctly, you can ignore this top kind of configuration.

84
00:14:52.890 --> 00:15:05.580
Gerald Glynn: And so, everything and we touch on she'll be in that of course in, and it is in the recordings as well for the class and so.

85
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:19.320
Gerald Glynn: That was that was the first week and, and this is wash just a recap on what we looked at last week, so we just zoomed in on html and discussed some of the.

86
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:29.550
Gerald Glynn: necessary elements so Doc type in order to tell your browser what type of document, it is so once we do Doc type html.

87
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:43.140
Gerald Glynn: And this, this is actually telling the browser this is written, not just an html it's actually html version five and I don't know why they chose is not to put five in here about him.

88
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.680
Gerald Glynn: Maybe they will in the future when it comes when he knows, six and seven rows and and then we just go stash.

89
00:15:51.150 --> 00:16:01.620
Gerald Glynn: We have like a tree architecture i'll touch on that may be a later today or next week and we'll do a visual representation of how your browser actually.

90
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:20.040
Gerald Glynn: A mental model of how your browser interprets your html and we discussed that has a head tag in the head tag we have a title and in the body that we just had some content and we we covered some and some basic tags in Nash.

91
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.580
Gerald Glynn: So just bring up.

92
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.850
Gerald Glynn: So this is a recap of where we were and last week.

93
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:53.040
Gerald Glynn: So we left some comments here of you know, things that we wanted to do and and we had another commentary around the footer was at john Nash, and some other and.

94
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:59.460
Gerald Glynn: Other bits and pieces, I might put dash and MySpace but this.

95
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.670
This project.

96
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:20.370
Gerald Glynn: So, and so one thing I want to do, while i'm writing my html file, I actually want to be able to see it in real time so just as a recap, if you right click are on your MAC control click.

97
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:39.150
Gerald Glynn: On the html5 we're looking at, we can do at copy pack don't copy relative path copy for that, and I can open up my browser and here, is where we am gotten last week.

98
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:54.600
Gerald Glynn: So what i'm proposing, and so what i'll do is i'll start fleshing out and and the skeleton for a website here and we can just.

99
00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:05.730
Gerald Glynn: Follow along and i'm putting the onus on the class any times and something is something you don't understand and put it in the chat.

100
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:22.410
Gerald Glynn: And we don't have learned in Charlie you, am shattered the question and, and if you if you have recommendations like it is something that you know within an html are a better approach, please speak up and.

101
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:34.020
Gerald Glynn: You know it's not that i'm there's many ways to solve the same problem and some ways are more elegant than others and but i'd like to know.

102
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:46.650
Gerald Glynn: i'd like to get your input on your experience with html in the past, maybe you saw something written another way and that would be a great teaching point to compare and contrast my approach versus something that you would have been more used to.

103
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:58.800
Gerald Glynn: And onwards and upwards I don't like first of all I don't like the color red on my headings i'm going to put that to aim to.

104
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.270
Gerald Glynn: refresh okay so.

105
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:24.000
Gerald Glynn: So and we're going to need some content for my website so what i'm going to do is a just because it's something i'm updating lately, and it might be a bad idea for some of your content is to use my CV.

106
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.120
Gerald Glynn: And for at least one of the pages.

107
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.470
Gerald Glynn: Sorry, when the lights flickering here.

108
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.130
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so this is so.

109
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:10.980
Gerald Glynn: We named the file index dot html, so this is and first of all, why index html.

110
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:26.100
Gerald Glynn: So and okay that doesn't work there, so, and when you go to a by default when this is actually hope it, this was hosted online I could.

111
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:37.980
Gerald Glynn: and give the person the URL to my domain, or the folder that contains html site and the first thing your.

112
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:45.990
Gerald Glynn: browser is going to do not surprised that the first thing that service going to do is check does this folder contain.

113
00:20:46.710 --> 00:21:00.570
Gerald Glynn: A index html then a render that so usually, when you go to a web page our websites nowadays you don't see index dot html you might just see a forward slash at the end.

114
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:13.350
Gerald Glynn: And there's there's a few things that could be going on, but at a static html and an aspect it's going to look for index html so that's why we named our.

115
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:29.460
Gerald Glynn: And we named our homepage on the first page index html i'm going to another you happy with this page, but I don't really know where we want to bring people, yes, so let's just start building at a second page so.

116
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.560
Gerald Glynn: Early my website and i'm going to create a.

117
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.090
Gerald Glynn: yep.

118
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.260
Charlie Gallagher: just put into the chat there could you go over how you did the style and color.

119
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.650
Gerald Glynn: The styling color yeah.

120
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:51.540
Gerald Glynn: And nets on and again i'm going to do this actually nine in the classroom.

121
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.210
Gerald Glynn: So question.

122
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.650
Gerald Glynn: So I won't answer that now.

123
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:19.350
Gerald Glynn: But we will get to it within today's class, but I should put it here as a reminder, so if I just move on, just so we can get a new m web page and.

124
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:35.190
Gerald Glynn: up and running and then we're going to have to then we're gonna have to find a way to link these pages, so that someone can navigate to your website So what should we say at the very start with these adult type we need em html.

125
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.300
Gerald Glynn: We need a head.

126
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:57.870
Gerald Glynn: And within that heads i'm going to push a CV title want to put the title of the page there and i'm going to build out late some am body within that so i'm just going to take some em.

127
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.150
Gerald Glynn: These things So where do I find.

128
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:20.190
Gerald Glynn: This page I could copy and paste the path air from vs code, but and i'm pretty smart and I can kind of guess where this fight is going to be so I just put it right beside index so now he's going to type in CV dot html.

129
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:35.730
Gerald Glynn: And I have a blank page, because I have no content, but I do have a title, so you can see here up in the tab and the tab has been given the word CV, and that is coming from here.

130
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:45.360
Gerald Glynn: So i'm going to first of all i'm going to give my page a heading to and i'm going to call this curriculum.

131
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:46.740
A.

132
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.970
Gerald Glynn: CV stands for and under this and going to list some.

133
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.770
Gerald Glynn: yeah I just do we start off with some work beans.

134
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.160
Gerald Glynn: I started off in education that's usually.

135
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:24.810
Gerald Glynn: doesn't so i'm going to do a heading to, and this is my education so one of the first things I might, and I do my education in reverse order going to Jewish game.

136
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.980
Gerald Glynn: So am I going to tease out a couple of ways to.

137
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:40.980
Gerald Glynn: To start this will start off with just putting it as kind of plain content so in and.

138
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.720
Gerald Glynn: So this is copied straight from my word document and.

139
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:57.000
Gerald Glynn: As you can see the the baseline is running off and I don't like that so i'm just going to go to view.

140
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:05.520
Gerald Glynn: And then toggle word ramp so this just keeps everything on the same page and, as we can see distill started line 11.

141
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:23.880
Gerald Glynn: These these following these are not new lines it's just wrapping them into that line and then my line is to maintain so that's line to him so let's give it up with what that looks like okay like grace kind of going off the page so and and also.

142
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:39.900
Gerald Glynn: I have a new line in here Bush it just runs straight over so one thing that we did learn is that we should be using and at least a paragraph tag sorry.

143
00:25:41.250 --> 00:26:00.360
Gerald Glynn: vs code, by default, we open creation and an element tag if it has a corresponding closing tag it's going to put you in for you it's it's usually a handful, but if you already have content in first it can get kind of annoying so that's just there so i'm going to.

144
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.950
Gerald Glynn: play tag here discontinue both of.

145
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:22.620
Gerald Glynn: Okay now uh gosh two lines of text looks a little bit nature and want to get this a bit more emphasis, so they already have.

146
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:30.240
Gerald Glynn: Their we have a heading to something i'll give this a heading three, is actually how I do have it in the word document.

147
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.450
Gerald Glynn: and adding three and refresh the token a bit nicer.

148
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.850
Gerald Glynn: And so, and then I have a paragraph presenting.

149
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:52.770
Gerald Glynn: So i'm i'm happy enough with that is a basic structure for my CV list so i'm just going to put in.

150
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.910
Gerald Glynn: A couple of more CV Asians.

151
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:16.740
Gerald Glynn: Actually, one thing i'm going to do what when text runs over a line, and I have these tags and running on the same line, I find it a little bit difficult to read, so what i'm going to do is press enter here.

152
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:31.920
Gerald Glynn: And press enter here and basically this thing, this is a paragraph and, and this is the block of text I just find it easier to read it's not and it's not technically important but remember.

153
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:42.840
Gerald Glynn: If you're writing html or any code, you have to think of two other people someone else that might be reading your code.

154
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:50.790
Gerald Glynn: And because they need to improve this, they need to refactor you may have left the company or the project and someone else is coming on board and taking on that page.

155
00:27:51.270 --> 00:28:01.440
Gerald Glynn: They may need to make additions to this and it's their job to do it, and the second person to think about is yourself in the future, whenever you whenever i'm working on something.

156
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:10.530
Gerald Glynn: i'm in the zone i'm I know exactly the context of what i'm working on, but two months later, when I revisit my code.

157
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:17.340
Gerald Glynn: I might completely forget what I was trying to achieve whatever so it's it's important to keep your code clean.

158
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:29.250
Gerald Glynn: And for others, but also for yourself in the future, because you will forget what you were trying to do and easily so i'm just going to copy and paste another block of text in there and we send them three.

159
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.920
and

160
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.180
Gerald Glynn: underneath ish we were going to give it a paragraph.

161
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:51.840
Gerald Glynn: There is, and I selected the text and i'm just clicking the tab open.

162
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.300
oops.

163
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:07.680
Gerald Glynn: Okay, and you can get press tab that in dense your text or your html by two spaces and which is.

164
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.110
Gerald Glynn: What most people do.

165
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:29.910
Gerald Glynn: i'm just gonna put in return, as sometimes sometimes it rather than having I just deletion at bring the cursor to the very start that line deletion bring it back to the previous line and then press enter and vs code is is very smart it understand where exactly to indented.

166
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.590
and

167
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.870
Gerald Glynn: And then we'll do one more.

168
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.230
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so now we have a.

169
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:21.720
Gerald Glynn: Now we have the headings and content underneath each okay any questions so far.

170
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.130
Gerald Glynn: So I have some things of interest here.

171
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.230
Gerald Glynn: That, if this was my web page i'd want people to.

172
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:47.250
Gerald Glynn: You know, and you know someone someone might not have ever heard of the national University of Ireland, you know I you know I want them to be able to see.

173
00:30:48.450 --> 00:31:04.560
Gerald Glynn: To to go to the national University of art and I want them to have to copy my pay copy and paste my tags and then do some kind of search, you know that's that's not very good user experience, so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to create a link.

174
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:30.750
Gerald Glynn: To anyway geez homepage so energy is energy.ie and i'm going to convert this into a link so in order for me to make a link we use what's called the anchor tag, and this is represented by, and this is.

175
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:41.940
Gerald Glynn: look up some quick documentation, and so the w three schools.

176
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:48.810
Gerald Glynn: i'd recommend it before, and also at mozilla so you feel visitor.

177
00:31:50.430 --> 00:32:04.410
Gerald Glynn: And tells us so it's giving an example, and so this is, this is an example on mozilla's website of some html, and this is what it looks like so.

178
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:19.050
Gerald Glynn: They have something that's called you add that, during a call it an ally and it's told me that the html a element, the tag is an anchor tag so it's actually.

179
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:39.150
Gerald Glynn: Even though they're giving me a lot of html there, this is the real and this is the real tag that's of interest so let's am just so i'm now cornered in a block i'm just going to create my anchor tag up here at first until I get used to it.

180
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.130
Gerald Glynn: And then we can we can put it into text so.

181
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:53.700
Gerald Glynn: With in the text with in an anchor tag is wash is and.

182
00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:12.420
Gerald Glynn: Is what the user visually sees so, and so the text in between the opening and closing tag is what the user sees so let's go to my CV and see what it actually looks like so it's created some.

183
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.900
Gerald Glynn: text there but it hasn't actually made it into a link.

184
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:30.840
Gerald Glynn: Back to documentation, so I need to bring them somewhere, so I need somewhere somehow tattle dash an anchor link where to go, so in order to do that we add what's called an attribution.

185
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.510
Gerald Glynn: So this is the first.

186
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:58.830
Gerald Glynn: Time we've really looked at this, we did we did technically we did add add an attribute last week when we're looking at images and we get him to with night but it's not a great example of an attribution but this one is so in order.

187
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:08.790
Gerald Glynn: In order for the link to nowhere to go it needs this attribute so the attribution is called a truth.

188
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:27.090
Gerald Glynn: And, and in order to add an attribute to an element, we we add contributes name, we add him as an equal signs and then we add at double quotes.

189
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:39.870
Gerald Glynn: So this is the attributes and what's in the double quotes is the value assigned to that attribution so i'm just going to copy and paste anyway G in there.

190
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:53.850
Gerald Glynn: Go back to my CV page and refresh and now I click on this kind of brings them to the page so i'm happy with dash.

191
00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:08.700
Gerald Glynn: And click so now i'm just going to accomplish and actually put it in my biography text I just like to sometimes write these things if they're within body attacks just working independently verse because it can guess and.

192
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.910
Gerald Glynn: You can get a little bit hard to kind of read, while i'm programming, so now I refresh.

193
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.190
Gerald Glynn: And I click.

194
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.430
Gerald Glynn: OK any questions any suggestions.

195
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:56.580
Gerald Glynn: So one thing I one thing I personally don't like is I want someone's on my website and and it's my intention to keep them on my website I don't want them going off getting distracted very easily distracted so one problem I see, is it clicked on this link.

196
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.310
Gerald Glynn: And now, and now they're interested in a big.

197
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:14.490
Gerald Glynn: And then five minutes later two hours later, like Oh, how did I end up here oh yeah I was reading Gerald CV 100 get back to Chelsea via back.

198
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:26.130
Gerald Glynn: I mean we have to go into my history so that's I think that's a bad user experience and for the user, because they probably do and come back to us that's also badge.

199
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:37.380
Gerald Glynn: You know, from a from our perspective, we want to keep them on the site, so we want to say that, so does anyone have any ideas of how I would.

200
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:51.720
Gerald Glynn: Allow them easily go to national university Bush somehow and Nash, get lost in energy and keep them somehow back to my site.

201
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.910
Emmanuel: You redirect the link to open a new tab.

202
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:03.090
Gerald Glynn: Who, I was not a man so Emanuel said to redirect the link to a new tab.

203
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:27.330
Gerald Glynn: So and you're on the money manual it's a technically it's not a redirect and i'll touch on redirects again and what your your that's a only a slight thing but i'm going to leave a note here, I have a question to answer, which is what is a redirect.

204
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.930
Gerald Glynn: i'm telling you it's not this, then we should find that at some.

205
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:35.100
Gerald Glynn: stage what it is and i'm just going to open up.

206
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.480
Where is our mozilla documentation.

207
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.060
Gerald Glynn: So and read through.

208
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.200
Gerald Glynn: These and we find something called tarnish.

209
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:10.170
Gerald Glynn: So where to display the link to URL as the name for browsing content, so this could be a tab a window and whatever so that it says here.

210
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:19.620
Gerald Glynn: That has a default, so we didn't give our anchor link a a target attribute.

211
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:41.940
Gerald Glynn: gosh and but it actually has one and it's it's given one by default and probably by the browser and the default one is self so that means when I click on this it's going to open this link in same and in the same window.

212
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:52.470
Gerald Glynn: We use the words nowadays window and tab quite interchangeably because, at the very start of web browsers.

213
00:38:53.310 --> 00:39:10.740
Gerald Glynn: We didn't have tabs and all you had was a new browser window in your browser window, so you should clarify what that means is this here within this browser window, I have four tabs open and this over here is a new tab.

214
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:30.660
Gerald Glynn: Is it is a new window so at that's what we mean by browser that's what we mean to distinguish window and tab, however, when a sweater was originally created there was no concept of a browser tab there was just a.

215
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:43.440
Gerald Glynn: There was just a window so sometimes you might see so here, it says blank usually a new tab but users can configure browsers open a new window so and.

216
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:51.210
Gerald Glynn: The blank thing the blank at the blank value for the target attributes, just as open me up in a new window.

217
00:39:51.900 --> 00:40:02.130
Gerald Glynn: and your browser and there is something in the settings to say anytime i'm told you doing your window just open a new tab and you can you can use the override dash within your.

218
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:11.550
Gerald Glynn: within your settings but, most people like to have it, as in a new tab, so this is an attribution so we just have to write another.

219
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.590
Gerald Glynn: And attributes within our anchor link, and this was called.

220
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:23.520
Gerald Glynn: target that is the name of that is the attribute equal signs.

221
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.950
Gerald Glynn: Double quotes and then we just give it a value blank.

222
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:54.930
Gerald Glynn: And now I will refresh now when I click on my ankle link fingers crossed it opens it up in a new and in a new tab and I can get lost on a new agey and I go where was I originally and I can see oh yeah I was looking at your CV I go back Jesse.

223
00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:00.270
Gerald Glynn: and any questions on that.

224
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:21.480
Gerald Glynn: So we can see here tarnish has some other attributes parents and top these are very, very us, this is the main reasons for these is the was a technology and.

225
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:35.880
Gerald Glynn: heavily used and called it friends, they are at very much recommended not to use i'm not going to be teaching I frames in this module and.

226
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:45.300
Gerald Glynn: But they were they were used when the wasn't and kind of something else Jesus said so a classic example is.

227
00:41:46.050 --> 00:42:07.890
Gerald Glynn: A few years ago, if you wanted to embed a YouTube video onto your site you're not hosting Nash YouTube video and YouTube is so what people would do is they'd create an iframe and YouTube would give you a URL and when I frame, it is it's almost like a little window into another and.

228
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:18.390
Gerald Glynn: A web page, so the reason why it's frowned upon is because now, you have a we talked about the Dom so now, you have the html Dom.

229
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:36.900
Gerald Glynn: And then within that you have a window to another html down and that web pages have could have other ones so it's very hard to and it's just badge kind of practice, but it was a workaround at the time and now with html5 we have tags like embed and we have other m.

230
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:48.780
Gerald Glynn: Other elements that we can use to do the same thing, so we don't want to use I frames and the reason why it has something like parents and top is because it has a link within Nash.

231
00:42:49.230 --> 00:43:05.010
Gerald Glynn: web page in the iframe if you click on it you're saying open up new from within the what iframe which you may want to reference the parent, which is yours so we're not going to go into those details, all you ever really need to know for tigers is blank.

232
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:18.720
Gerald Glynn: So there's a couple of other attributes there and we're not going to go into them for anchor tags.

233
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.690
Gerald Glynn: Okay, take a look at my CV okay so.

234
00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:34.500
Gerald Glynn: that's okay for education so i'm going to move on and population myself CV with some work experience.

235
00:43:41.340 --> 00:44:05.580
Gerald Glynn: he's going to clean this up rubbish anytime any as we discussed last week, these enters these new line breaks and don't affect the html at all so, and this is this can be frustrating at once, you understand why and how to get an English, then you can do.

236
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:16.380
Gerald Glynn: You can work around this so actually one thing that was mentioned last week is you can you can introduce the break element.

237
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.190
Gerald Glynn: And this is this is.

238
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:30.030
Gerald Glynn: This is an basically it's like a blank paragraph it says, this is just going to force a break let's see what that looks like at the bottom.

239
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.180
Gerald Glynn: didn't really do anything.

240
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:38.670
Okay.

241
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.540
Gerald Glynn: So that's quite a gap there.

242
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.550
Gerald Glynn: have one.

243
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:56.940
Gerald Glynn: It still feels a bit big not gonna one of the problems I have with this is looking is the gap between.

244
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:15.270
Gerald Glynn: The paragraph and the hedging is the same as the gap between the paragraph and then below So for me visually it doesn't actually look like that paragraph belongs under that heading so let's park that for now and that's will look at dash and later on.

245
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:25.500
Gerald Glynn: So what I say next is work experience, so I did my education as a heading to so i'm going to do work experience as.

246
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:27.960
You.

247
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.880
Gerald Glynn: And then i'm going to put in an example of so much experience.

248
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.890
Gerald Glynn: This is my current.

249
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:42.570
Gerald Glynn: role.

250
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:48.870
Gerald Glynn: For.

251
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.290
Gerald Glynn: So.

252
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.200
Gerald Glynn: Okay, nothing new there.

253
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.630
Gerald Glynn: Now i've.

254
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:19.830
Gerald Glynn: read through the Bible because quite me see this as many times i'm a front end developer data analyst on swagger up a pleasure it's my prayer okay.

255
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:40.470
Gerald Glynn: swagger is it a SAS rest API designed to have a little both cloud and on premise responsibilities include delivering every features continue maintaining have a fee here means front end front end stack which includes when I give a big long list of things that I do so and.

256
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:50.820
Gerald Glynn: So for printed CV I want to keep my CV to two pages so that's why I kind of have that dense push now we have a web page now so.

257
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.640
Gerald Glynn: i'd like to make this last part always more readable.

258
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:04.140
Gerald Glynn: Can anyone give me suggestions of how I might make those lists of technologies more readable.

259
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.980
Gerald Glynn: So if you were doing if you were representing this and word.

260
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:22.770
Gerald Glynn: Would you would you normally have a long list of items like that are getting.

261
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:23.700
planes.

262
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:25.710
Gerald Glynn: Sagan email.

263
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.000
Emer McGovern: Bulletin yeah.

264
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:33.060
Gerald Glynn: yeah so as you can and yeah so bullet points are a.

265
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:49.140
Gerald Glynn: perfect example of this, so when we talk about something, and so the bullet point is the each item and those bullet points belong to a list so.

266
00:47:49.920 --> 00:48:01.770
Gerald Glynn: You probably know this from just experience but there's two types of lists you sometimes see lists with bullet points and you sometimes see lists with numbers.

267
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:24.480
Gerald Glynn: And an html we have two elements for each of those lists types, one of them is called an ordered list an ordered list that is when it has numbers and and and then we have an ordered list, which is when we have bullet points so i'm just going to go to my.

268
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:39.060
Gerald Glynn: And mozilla documentation here and i'm going to put in for for me, you know it's not important the order of these it's i'm not getting steps you know i'm not.

269
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:45.270
Gerald Glynn: ranking things in some kind of flow so i'm going to use an on ordered list and then maybe later on, we can find.

270
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:59.280
Gerald Glynn: A good example for my CV or some some rounds, to use an ordered list so so our demos at a documentation, we have the on the ordered list element click on Nash, and see what that.

271
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:12.330
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so it gives me an example of html and how that renders oce so as you can see that's pretty Nice and also something it does actually is, it has.

272
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:25.140
Gerald Glynn: And nested So if I wanted to have a bullet point entrepreneur point So the first thing we need to do and i'm going to give me some some some space here is.

273
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:47.160
Gerald Glynn: So I am going to say continuously maintaining our front end stack which includes, and this is my list so i'm going to open up with the ul tag which stands for an ordered list and I need to give us a list item, so this here and I is the list item within each and is.

274
00:49:48.180 --> 00:50:00.990
Gerald Glynn: The list Asian within the on ordered list Okay, so I have quite a chunk of things there so i'll put in some of them, he has six he has an item list and react.

275
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.550
Gerald Glynn: What i'm typing in these feel free to jump in with any questions.

276
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.330
Gerald Glynn: Just do two more.

277
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:59.040
Gerald Glynn: And then I have this other item on my CV and testing with jest So for me that feels like a set brush.

278
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:09.120
Gerald Glynn: listen more technology is there for some feels like to me like a separate list i'm going to create a list item called testing.

279
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:16.740
Gerald Glynn: And now, this list item is a list itself.

280
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:24.990
Gerald Glynn: So let's see how we can do that, so another coat on on that, just so it looks Nice.

281
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:31.440
Gerald Glynn: And here i'm craving a second on ordered this.

282
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.030
Gerald Glynn: And i'm putting going to copy and paste these in.

283
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.040
Gerald Glynn: And just is what is, for your testing.

284
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.390
Gerald Glynn: company based based.

285
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.170
Gerald Glynn: Okay.

286
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:32.310
Gerald Glynn: So, as you can see here, these are just written in one line or because the list is and testing contains another and block element I can now.

287
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:41.250
Gerald Glynn: Bring that closing tag down to here and anything I want with the end that tag, then I can rise again to look and.

288
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:49.080
Gerald Glynn: This is probably our first decent example of elements within elements, so now we have nested elements within our.

289
00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:51.990
Gerald Glynn: and

290
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.540
Gerald Glynn: Okay, any questions on this.

291
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:18.150
Gerald Glynn: and aware that aesthetically my CV and my html is looking great but that's now we won't we're not going to address that in.

292
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:26.460
Gerald Glynn: html we're going to address that when we introduce styling so Personally, I really like these bullet points.

293
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:42.450
Gerald Glynn: and definitely the harder ones that don't like him so i'm going to want to address that, but this is this is how, and this is how opera has decided to render those bullet points let's just quickly look at how another.

294
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.060
Gerald Glynn: browser granderson.

295
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.570
Gerald Glynn: So this is very.

296
00:53:52.170 --> 00:54:09.660
Gerald Glynn: it's pretty much the same i'm just going to do a quick comparison with firefox there was a time where at browsers when it came to things like lists and headings, they and there was quite a lot of difference between them, I think they've all.

297
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:13.740
Gerald Glynn: they've all started to.

298
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:32.640
Gerald Glynn: Look same yes pretty much the same 5%, so I think a lot of prizes now they are default styling it's kind of em is more lined up, but you may come across as some time where you you, you would you were developing your Web.

299
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:42.930
Gerald Glynn: site using our prayer or firefox and then someone opens it up a user example is Internet explorer and not completely different.

300
00:54:43.440 --> 00:55:00.480
Gerald Glynn: So one of the things we want to ensure that Iran is dash we have very strict styling in place so that there is no difference between browsers and we have full control over that and that there's consistency across all will and will handle that later.

301
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:07.650
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so what else do we have in my CV.

302
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:26.460
Gerald Glynn: Is a lot of items here, but there i'm looking for things that we might want to style differently and Okay, actually, I have a section called skills and interest and use as an example because there's actually a lot of Sub headings in Nash.

303
00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:38.160
Gerald Glynn: So I leave work experience for now i'm going to put in to copy and paste in a big blob of.

304
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:44.490
Gerald Glynn: text and i'm going to clean this up so skills, an interesting comes under heading to.

305
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:56.550
Gerald Glynn: And under that I have a skill or interest which is analytics i'm going to put that up on the head in three.

306
00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:03.150
Gerald Glynn: And i'm going to push details about dash pain, a paragraph.

307
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.000
Gerald Glynn: same here.

308
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:41.850
Gerald Glynn: So here, I have a heading three, and then I have something i've broken this out into other things we can go heading for can remember have five know headings, I think it's up to heading six and then, and there is no heading seven, and in html and summarizes my.

309
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:57.180
Gerald Glynn: Do something with this, but as far as you know, adding six is the and the last page and here i'm talking about front end react so kind of put dash in adding as well.

310
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:11.130
Gerald Glynn: Okay i'm gonna pull out some of these so Nash.

311
00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.430
Gerald Glynn: Is.

312
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:20.700
Gerald Glynn: Just do one more, and then I had that list is front end.

313
00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:23.820
Gerald Glynn: experience.

314
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.870
And this is back.

315
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:45.150
Gerald Glynn: And then here, I have something knowledge of.

316
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.210
Gerald Glynn: i'm going to leave it at that, because it's nothing new to us, so the main.

317
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.710
Gerald Glynn: The main point here is dash.

318
00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:08.160
Gerald Glynn: And it's for assigning perspective, I can put in heading to Heading three, and then have sub headings and further.

319
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:09.840
Gerald Glynn: and

320
00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:21.720
Gerald Glynn: had to give an example of em heading sub headings again can anyone think of any other reason why it might be good to use headings, other than a visual.

321
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.150
Gerald Glynn: So when I read this as a human being.

322
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:45.780
Gerald Glynn: I see work experience and then I see this and do this when I see education, and I see this.

323
00:58:47.010 --> 00:59:01.710
Gerald Glynn: As under education, and I see this under that heading So for me I I understand visually from what is look like that this paragraph.

324
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:16.740
Gerald Glynn: Is under this heading and the dis heading is under this heading, but so visually there when I when I read this they're nested But when I look at html.

325
00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:23.520
Gerald Glynn: they're not nested so what I what I mean by nested is within our this list.

326
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:46.350
Gerald Glynn: This you know exists under this list item, when I look at heading to the paragraph isn't part of the html three tag it said, its own level two and you can see that, within the html sitting there at the same level, but visually and how I comprehend it is that it is endless.

327
00:59:47.430 --> 01:00:08.310
Gerald Glynn: So and and we want, and when a search Bosch comes and read our website, or when a blind person uses em some technology to read the website as them and to them and some I don't know if anyone's heritage or use any.

328
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.290
Gerald Glynn: Any of those two called area tools.

329
01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:29.850
Gerald Glynn: And Bush I work with and a group of blind people and it's amazing to actually see how they navigate the website so when when when when one of those tools.

330
01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:39.450
Gerald Glynn: would read this website and to them, you know it doesn't really make sense for to start reading ash top to bottom everything.

331
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:50.310
Gerald Glynn: Because this is a long CV so they might have it set up to say Okay, first of all read me out the headings and that's all so they can read out this.

332
01:00:51.030 --> 01:01:04.710
Gerald Glynn: This and this and then the blind person can get back to say okay and read out the content under the second so betting that you gave me so they can talk to the machine like that.

333
01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:18.420
Gerald Glynn: Also, when a search Bosch a scanning your content it's really important that this it knows that what i'm writing here belongs under this so this.

334
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:42.360
Gerald Glynn: is something i'm going to be driving home quite large is this is the main, and this is the motivation for using headings Nash, how they look so a common thing that people do is they come along here and they say, well, this is really big so i'm going to make that a heading for.

335
01:01:47.400 --> 01:02:02.250
Gerald Glynn: High that looks nicer it's not so big I don't want to give it so much tension, this is not good, because it does a heading to heading forward so I go, whereas heading three, you know, and this is going to throw a search bar off and.

336
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:06.180
Gerald Glynn: So we use when we're using.

337
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:24.150
Gerald Glynn: Am heading tags and building up a hierarchy of them it's very important that we stick to and the order H1 H2 H3 if you don't like how it looks that's that's a problem that solved elsewhere.

338
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:29.760
Gerald Glynn: Okay.

339
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.730
Gerald Glynn: So we're an hour in.

340
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.000
Gerald Glynn: Any questions.

341
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.500
Baptiste Gilistro: awesome so pretty fair to me.

342
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.460
Gerald Glynn: Okay.

343
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:48.330
Thanks buddy.

344
01:02:49.350 --> 01:03:09.390
Gerald Glynn: So so maybe I think a next step from here might be good to am stuck because we were discussing signing that that's The next step i'll take a within with this evidence, the example and what i'm going to do is.

345
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:15.810
Gerald Glynn: say I want to post this up see have.

346
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.090
Gerald Glynn: came.

347
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:19.980
Gerald Glynn: Around to.

348
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:37.410
Gerald Glynn: Oh yeah we'll continue on and so last week we touched on, we did some styling we put it at the top of the html page, and this is called embedded so.

349
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.060
Gerald Glynn: And so, this lives in the head.

350
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:44.460
Gerald Glynn: So we say style.

351
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:47.820
Gerald Glynn: And then now within the style block.

352
01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:54.090
Gerald Glynn: And the codes that we raised with any steinbach This is called CSS.

353
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:56.310
Gerald Glynn: So.

354
01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:59.160
Gerald Glynn: who's here.

355
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:05.790
Gerald Glynn: And all I did there was if you select.

356
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:20.910
Gerald Glynn: Any piece of text and press command forward slash it turns whatever, whatever your selected into what we call a comment, so a comment and.

357
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:46.380
Gerald Glynn: Is it won't be rendered ash to the html this this comment wouldn't be anyways and but let's say for an example like Okay, you know, this is something i'm working on, but I don't want it to be it's not ready, yes, so I can just do em command or control forward slash and this will turn into.

358
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:57.060
Gerald Glynn: A common so that's as we can see that Nash, and visible within the browser if I inspect element.

359
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.300
Gerald Glynn: So, as we looked at last week, if I right click.

360
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:20.550
Gerald Glynn: It within the browser and say inspect element, it brings me to a tab called elements, so this is html as the browser is is it still there it's just and you can see it's actually great items within the tools it's just totally knowledge and so let's actually put that in our example.

361
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.120
Gerald Glynn: This is a html comment.

362
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:55.980
Gerald Glynn: As I said, we're now within the style tank so with in within the confines of the opening and closing style tag we're not writing html we're writing CSS, and this is what a CSS comment looks like.

363
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:13.560
Gerald Glynn: And it's usually something that's useful if if it's not clear wash some of your code is doing to explain to those two other people that we talked about the other.

364
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:23.220
Gerald Glynn: Am programming and yourself in the future and and then the other time it's useful is if something isn't working that you've tried.

365
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:30.420
Gerald Glynn: Rather than deleting the code, you can just come to them and then see you know see if you can solve that so let's do some styling here.

366
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:47.070
Gerald Glynn: So one thing I don't and I want to start my heading one tag so in here, I do H1 and i'm like wait, this is left aligned on my CV it's it's central to the page.

367
01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:53.400
Gerald Glynn: And also it's named RON curriculum the day.

368
01:06:54.930 --> 01:07:04.200
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so we're going to want to align that text so in word our word passes into We might say it's left aligned.

369
01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:20.820
Gerald Glynn: Are right aligned if you're by default, if your language reads right to left as it does in Arabic and then there's centered and there's another one called justified so we're going to see if we can find out how can we am central Texas.

370
01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:29.190
Gerald Glynn: So aim and CSS text to nine see what Dr go because it's fear sells.

371
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:37.830
Gerald Glynn: Can it gives the Web three and then the mozilla it's going to open up these both because a.

372
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:49.560
Gerald Glynn: I like mozilla I use mozilla's documentation at work, because it's it's very technical and it's it's got a lot of good support behind it, but I have found when I was learning.

373
01:07:50.220 --> 01:08:03.030
Gerald Glynn: Either new elements are learning web development at the start and web three schools had em kind of Nice nice learner approach to examples let's just look at this one, so it says.

374
01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:14.520
Gerald Glynn: It is Dave does a dub be that I don't know what that means put in the black side you know what it means push we haven't covered that yet.

375
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:23.730
Gerald Glynn: But in the end it says text align Center so just seen that so i'm I want to tell each one.

376
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.630
Gerald Glynn: element to introduce i'm going to give us a.

377
01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:37.680
Gerald Glynn: Next aligned and then all my vs code is really smart and it knows all the values that this m.

378
01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:47.610
Gerald Glynn: That text align and accepts, so one of them is Center and it's putting that presenter and I put a semi colon at the end.

379
01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:59.910
Gerald Glynn: This is our first time looking at html is kind of code push we don't have to adhere to which coding practices is, it is a type of coding and.

380
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:12.150
Gerald Glynn: In a lot of coding languages, when we want to tell, whatever the interpreter of the code is that this is the end of the line, say, we call on semi colon is m.

381
01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:23.040
Gerald Glynn: pretty much in all of them and CSS him muted as well let's go back to my CV refresh good okay my.

382
01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:39.840
Gerald Glynn: we're heading is now in the middle okay i'm looking for i'm not a great designer so can anyone give me some input on how you think this my CV could look better.

383
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:32.640
Gerald Glynn: There was a recommendation earlier on, regarding add color can remember who put that in the chat with that.

384
01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:35.040
Gerald Glynn: Just was that you to put in color.

385
01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.520
Gerald Glynn: To take and i'm going to take this question and starting Connor as our next.

386
01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:56.940
Gerald Glynn: thing to do so and i'm going to give my H1 tag a color.

387
01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:07.740
Gerald Glynn: So we just say color and CSS and html I written in American English, so we don't have all your it's got it.

388
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:16.560
Gerald Glynn: And it comes provided a list of colors by names let's see on there.

389
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:23.640
Gerald Glynn: i'm going to go for dark Simon.

390
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.930
Gerald Glynn: This is a color and the colors name.

391
01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:32.430
Gerald Glynn: Fresh okay.

392
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.790
Gerald Glynn: Now I like that color and so i'm going to I want.

393
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:47.130
Gerald Glynn: I want my heading tues to also have that color, so I do H2.

394
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.660
Gerald Glynn: i'm just going to copy and paste his line.

395
01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.050
Gerald Glynn: refresh and our education, work experience skill skill and interest all have dark side.

396
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.440
Gerald Glynn: i'm writing the same thing twice, I think I mentioned this before.

397
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:11.580
Gerald Glynn: And in programming, we want to.

398
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:14.130
Gerald Glynn: We want to be driving.

399
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.750
Gerald Glynn: want to write our code try.

400
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.170
Gerald Glynn: and dry stands for don't.

401
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:24.840
repeat.

402
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.810
yourself.

403
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:46.140
Gerald Glynn: So i'm appreciating myself here, this is fine it's only a small web page, but if my company had a branding and dark side on was the color of choice for.

404
01:12:46.710 --> 01:13:04.560
Gerald Glynn: For content all over the website Sunday, I would find myself and having this color dioxide repeated in multiple places and then one day conferences okay we're going to do a rebrand we're no longer using dark siren we're using.

405
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:07.740
Gerald Glynn: To.

406
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:17.580
Gerald Glynn: and his web developer and refresh and actually that's too close we've got to do a big rebranding and we're.

407
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.540
Gerald Glynn: Changing everything to deep pink.

408
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:37.920
Gerald Glynn: And I say to the marketing designer people that come to me and says yeah I changed is to bring in as a no, no, you have to do this when you have to order them.

409
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:49.170
Gerald Glynn: Oh man that's like everywhere, I have this referenced hundreds of places i'm going to have to now go to my code base vinyls basis to this anytime we have.

410
01:13:50.250 --> 01:14:00.030
Gerald Glynn: lines of code or patient it's Jupiter work that's going to have to do the work that's been done today, but they maintain ability of my code now increases quite a lot.

411
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:10.860
Gerald Glynn: So I can say what I want my heading 1am I heading tues to be deep think so I can group at.

412
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.250
Gerald Glynn: These.

413
01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:20.820
Gerald Glynn: blocks.

414
01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:41.610
Gerald Glynn: So now, at my which one is Center lined and now i'm saying, well, I want to group, like colors so I can actually I can repeat page one here, I can actually repeat a one by itself, and do, and he looks to the as an exercise.

415
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:54.540
Gerald Glynn: But you can repeat your these ah ah ah ones they're not am.

416
01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:05.460
Gerald Glynn: You know, not everything has to be under the same block, so this this here, it just makes sense to break out the color and I want your brain to H1 and H2.

417
01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:07.680
and

418
01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.210
Gerald Glynn: Any questions on Nash.

419
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:37.470
Gerald Glynn: Okay now here's something interesting on it ah, one is told to be text align Center in the color blue and then after that i'm i'm told each one is to have the color pink so anyone have any guesses what's going to happen.

420
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:52.800
Gerald Glynn: it's one or two things by each one is going to be blue are deep think so, and give me a thumbs up on your.

421
01:15:54.870 --> 01:16:01.560
Gerald Glynn: You got emojis on your who's my eyes cleaner, is there a mo geez listed on your zoom to.

422
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:10.560
Emer McGovern: me yeah there is under reactions it's a clapping hands tommy's or laffy face shocked harish or.

423
01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:13.140
Gerald Glynn: Like apparently yeah.

424
01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.960
Gerald Glynn: disappeared from my.

425
01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:17.040
Emer McGovern: thing I had in the last day.

426
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.920
Gerald Glynn: It just means polling new shirt no date.

427
01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.610
Gerald Glynn: picker rooms okay anyways.

428
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:37.020
Gerald Glynn: You I disappear off my thing, but they should be on your side, maybe because i'm the host and so i'm going to put it i'm going to put you all in gallery view.

429
01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:47.130
Gerald Glynn: So, if you think the color is blue give me a thumbs up reaction.

430
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:52.980
Gerald Glynn: Okay, we got one thumbs up thumbs up.

431
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:55.560
Gerald Glynn: thumbs up.

432
01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:07.290
Gerald Glynn: Okay 407 to touch on them Okay, so we have four in terms of bloom and put your thumbs up everything that's going to be deep link.

433
01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.650
Gerald Glynn: This that.

434
01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:14.160
Gerald Glynn: and

435
01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:16.800
Gerald Glynn: The other ones.

436
01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:35.010
Gerald Glynn: Okay i'm gonna pull I gotta pull some actual Paul you had thumbs up for H1 being blue, can you give me time i'm not expecting you to be other islands and is wondering what Why would, why do you think it would be blue.

437
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:43.740
Gerald Glynn: And Bali they're.

438
01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.720
Charlie Gallagher: Currently, put in the chat there that he is at work he doesn't have a.

439
01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:59.550
Gerald Glynn: mouth so and and learn I am I am just going off memory now lauren you had you had ah one was going to be blue Joanna.

440
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:10.860
Lauren Coffey: yeah I said blue because it's the first one you have there, and you just have each one, whereas the pink has he decided as well, but that's a clear on.

441
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:16.710
Gerald Glynn: Who notes and logic, so I mean there's a couple of reasons.

442
01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:17.940
Gerald Glynn: First of all, it's.

443
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:21.120
Gerald Glynn: And I talked about H1 twice.

444
01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:31.800
Gerald Glynn: And the first time I talked about ish I say it's blue so that sounds logic and the other one which is a good point.

445
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:44.010
Gerald Glynn: And doesn't really apply to this, but it does apply later on, is you know this block is about hate ones and twos so that sounded a little bit more ambiguous so maybe.

446
01:18:44.730 --> 01:19:01.230
Gerald Glynn: Maybe CSS says, well, this one is blue is on H1 so this should take precedence, so I think there's definitely send things there and H2 and I think I saw your thumbs up for you think H1 will be pink.

447
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:08.100
Anne Harmon: yeah I I don't really know what it would be their way, but my thought is because it's the newer entry.

448
01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:09.810
Anne Harmon: Okay, would override.

449
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.340
Anne Harmon: The older one but.

450
01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.860
Gerald Glynn: yeah that's good sound logic there.

451
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.200
Gerald Glynn: So, because just to.

452
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:34.590
Gerald Glynn: rehash that so because the color on the H1 is a newer entry it had a came afterwards, and that that would maybe kind of override a previous one okay we've waited long enough let's refresh your page.

453
01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:36.750
Gerald Glynn: What is.

454
01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:40.020
Gerald Glynn: Of course.

455
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:56.340
Gerald Glynn: Yes, so each one I refresh there ah, one is a deep link and just to make sure so it's good when you're doing these things like Oh, maybe you know, maybe my blue color wasn't actually done correctly, so what i'm doing here is i'm.

456
01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.870
Gerald Glynn: Testing my my logic i'm like okay so.

457
01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:10.770
Gerald Glynn: In this is the testing analogy, but in when you're when you're trying to understand or depot your code.

458
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:16.110
Gerald Glynn: And you're commenting things in a house and changing things you're essentially testing in your own way.

459
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.030
Gerald Glynn: And it's important that if you're building a theological framework in your mind.

460
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:29.310
Gerald Glynn: They say never trust a test you haven't seen break, so in this case, I want to test equations I want to make sure blue does actually work and that wasn't.

461
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:40.110
Gerald Glynn: written incorrectly or maybe maybe he maybe CSS doesn't even know what blue is and so i've seen a blue and now i'm going to put in my deep pink refresh and.

462
01:20:41.310 --> 01:21:03.900
Gerald Glynn: So it's the second one, and the reason why, and I knew at you, you had a good example, there is because it's the last entry is overrides the previous entry, so we talked about what CSS stands for it's called a cascading.

463
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.740
Gerald Glynn: style.

464
01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.810
Gerald Glynn: sheet.

465
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:19.500
Gerald Glynn: And this is what the cascading means so any it's not a great word it doesn't.

466
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:37.020
Gerald Glynn: I don't think it kind of explains very well, but it means that the last thing that the CSS renders is is will override anything before this is both a blessing and a curse so at work.

467
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:48.780
Gerald Glynn: We have to be very careful how we write CSS because, if I wrote a and as a block of CSS that was only because it was lower jam.

468
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:59.970
Gerald Glynn: Before in a previous one, and if it was time using something I could end up, and I can end up breaking the styling of something else.

469
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:08.400
Gerald Glynn: Totally somewhere else totally on the website, but I wasn't even looking at and my QA tester they might never ever told so.

470
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:22.470
Gerald Glynn: And that's its curse but the blessing, is that it gives you a lot of control and over everybody let's actually look at the browser and web development tools i'm going to right click on that heading.

471
01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:36.030
Gerald Glynn: And at today's we've just been looking at the elements here and that reflects pretty closely the hmm of emerging and i'm going to pull this tab over.

472
01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:55.290
Gerald Glynn: And here, it shows me and within this window, it shows me as a tab called styles and any patient or any adamant I select it will tell me the styling of that element so here.

473
01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:06.090
Gerald Glynn: It says it was blue and then has a strike to Jewish because this one came nature and over relish so that is.

474
01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:17.520
Gerald Glynn: The cascading nature of style sheets and what's nice about this as styles development tools is I can actually toggle things on enough, so I can be.

475
01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:29.490
Gerald Glynn: It is very useful for debugging I can see Oh, I put a deep pink what happens if I turn that off Oh, it goes back to blue so within these tools, you can am in real time and.

476
01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:48.270
Gerald Glynn: You can interact with so of course anything I do here doesn't stick, so I toggled all the styling off that I did notice refresh and it goes back to normal, so you just interacting with document in the browser you're doing nothing, with the source code.

477
01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.710
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so also so.

478
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.340
Gerald Glynn: Before I move on any questions on that.

479
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:08.220
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so and so before, so I wrote this code, I wrote this code what's this underneath.

480
01:24:09.570 --> 01:24:13.890
Gerald Glynn: So, before I little bugbear about em.

481
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:28.620
Gerald Glynn: But they didn't feel the paragraph below the heading three look like it was part of touch because the because the gap here and the CAP period is the same, so why is.

482
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:42.540
Gerald Glynn: It click on Heading three, and I look at styles here and it it, it has loads of size listed that I didn't right, so this these styles are being and.

483
01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:55.200
Gerald Glynn: These are the defaults ties it actually says a user agent styles each user agent means the browser in this context, so opera has said, well, the way I do it is entries his.

484
01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:10.530
Gerald Glynn: I give them these am staying so let's look at these for a moment, so fun side I don't mind a fun size margin block start merging in line start and.

485
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:22.140
Gerald Glynn: So margin sounds like it's the thing at the top and the bottom and it's applying them using margin so so what i'm going to do is.

486
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:34.140
Gerald Glynn: I can't the the user agent style sheet, I can toggle these on and off, but a nice thing I can do is anything that's selected here, I can rise in real time.

487
01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:40.140
Gerald Glynn: My CSS so first of all, do something that we used to do color.

488
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:49.290
Gerald Glynn: And i'm going to get a bit more imaginative with clothes and okay let's go for this and i'm aware.

489
01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:57.870
Gerald Glynn: to chop my color choices aren't the best and i'm dealing with what, what are the default colors and before we finish up.

490
01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:19.980
Gerald Glynn: What we'll do is we'll look at how to actually apply your own colors and side of the browsers Polish so cool Okay, so I did I did that on on the element didn't apply to any other means, because actually what it's doing here in the browser is it's writing this right into the tag.

491
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.080
Gerald Glynn: So I can see there.

492
01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:38.100
Gerald Glynn: And when I turned it off just introduced that CSS comment that we had before so what's this doing in real time is just flying my tab colors into the tag, so this is what we talked about before we said in line styling.

493
01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:55.980
Gerald Glynn: The unfortunate part of an inciting I mean the good thing is that we can target something very easily and just hang on but we like to keep our signs outside of the html because the different concerns so for the browser This is fine, what it's doing but let's see if I can get.

494
01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:00.540
tricky.

495
01:27:05.730 --> 01:27:07.620
Gerald Glynn: know it needs at least one styled to.

496
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:19.830
Gerald Glynn: create a new style block here and I don't know what I want to do it, yet I haven't started just kind of give us a basic and.

497
01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:31.620
Gerald Glynn: When was the color we gather, we have a blue it's going to write this on my goals and I will show you I know it's now refresh all my heading trees now are blue then right click on Nash.

498
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:36.870
Gerald Glynn: And i'm going to click on the element tag here.

499
01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.560
Gerald Glynn: And now, it gives me element style, so I can override dash.

500
01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:54.060
Gerald Glynn: For that particular element, but that's not really much easier, I want to, I want to be able to try and style in real time.

501
01:27:54.660 --> 01:28:04.980
Gerald Glynn: On all my heading three, because I want to see what they look like and now, because I have at least one heading 3am style written now I can interact directly with the Dom.

502
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:18.960
Gerald Glynn: and adding things here so let's do it's just the font size so actually that was one of the things I had an issue with I was tempted to give these are heading for because they want the font size to be smaller but now I can.

503
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:20.880
Gerald Glynn: Now I can.

504
01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:31.200
Gerald Glynn: override the user agent the the browsers funds is very in tune with my own preferred one so here, you see a list of and.

505
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:35.490
Gerald Glynn: Here we see medium large.

506
01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:44.310
Gerald Glynn: and small small small NGO smaller and extradited to go and medium.

507
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:48.870
Gerald Glynn: And what was the other.

508
01:28:49.980 --> 01:29:08.040
Gerald Glynn: thing I had an issue with I I wanted the text below to feel like it was more part of that heading, so this underneath so let's just I saw it said something about margin block margin, and this is look at computed so there's a confusion tab.

509
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:15.000
Gerald Glynn: And this, and this breaks down and this shows me.

510
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:24.990
Gerald Glynn: What this has actually been how it's been completed and and what's actually being understood, first of all, one thing very interesting is.

511
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:36.210
Gerald Glynn: color doesn't show blue it actually shows something orgy be 00 to five five let's look at that nature so that's what it's computing the color blue to be.

512
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:49.680
Gerald Glynn: Then I have display block and it's this block and and started being calculated so blocking and block margin block and and block storage, I think there and.

513
01:29:51.030 --> 01:30:02.490
Gerald Glynn: New CSS stuff that they're bringing in and Bush i'm going to start off i'm going to do this with a simpler CSS and it's just called em.

514
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:08.640
Gerald Glynn: margin, and I can just do dash and bottom.

515
01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.690
Gerald Glynn: And let's just give that a 02 it does.

516
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.080
Gerald Glynn: Okay, to do.

517
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.030
computed.

518
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:23.490
Gerald Glynn: ergin and managing.

519
01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:32.910
Gerald Glynn: It didn't bring the paragraph up i'm going to look at the paragraph, it has its own margin.

520
01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:59.010
Gerald Glynn: that's sticking up, I want to, and I want to decrease that as well, this is where margins gets a little confusing and when we won't look at it today, but we'll we'll discuss and how our html renders days and squares and how things are respected so just for add two days.

521
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.940
Gerald Glynn: Okay i'm gonna use a hacky solution for today and.

522
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:13.290
Gerald Glynn: we'll see so I made the margin zero so before.

523
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:26.610
Gerald Glynn: Before when I didn't have a margin, when I hover over the element I see it highlights it in in the browser it highlights.

524
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:44.280
Gerald Glynn: The text of the elements and blue, and then it has this orange top and bottom, so the orange is the margin of around that box now when I put in the margin bottom to be zero when I hover over now I only have a margin at the top.

525
01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:55.770
Gerald Glynn: And the gap is still being maintained because of the margin on the paragraph, so one way to deal with this and we'll come up with a better solution.

526
01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:17.070
Gerald Glynn: Is you can actually have minus margins so minus margin just says well i'm going to pull the thing up blow me up into me so we get minus 20 pixels see that looks like or very touch amigo 1816.

527
01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:18.780
Gerald Glynn: that's Nice.

528
01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:29.580
Gerald Glynn: So the reason why I did this is because well I don't want to I don't want to remove the top margins and all paragraphs, like the might be.

529
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:42.150
Gerald Glynn: Reasons for maintain that most of the tub elsewhere in this particular scenario want when it's below adding three that it's closer to wish, so now i'm using a minus minus margin.

530
01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:45.270
Gerald Glynn: And i'm going to remove.

531
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.270
and

532
01:32:51.840 --> 01:33:01.470
Gerald Glynn: So now, when I look at this okay i'm happy with that uh gosh mighty so Now for my headings threes i'm going to do fun size.

533
01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:14.610
Gerald Glynn: medium so everything I did here was just in the browser because it's I find it a nicer way to write CSS and in real time, so I can see, but of course I need to put this actually in my CSS block.

534
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:27.090
Gerald Glynn: And then I didn't mind margin bottom line is 12 pixels save and now i'm going to refresh my page, which will remove any work, I was doing here, so this is.

535
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:38.970
Gerald Glynn: This is one caveat to remember is when your styling in here as soon as you refresh the page, you lose everything you've worked on so it's kind of like a little bit of em.

536
01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:59.550
Gerald Glynn: kind of digital workspace don't don't if you have something that you're happy with make sure you get into your CSS before so refresh and now, when I go to Heading three, I can see my styles are there because they inherited from my CSS book okay we're coming up to 22 so.

537
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:03.090
Gerald Glynn: Any questions so far.

538
01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.280
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so I started off.

539
01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:22.410
Gerald Glynn: With a my homepage.

540
01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.810
Gerald Glynn: The homepage is looking very unloved good person to my CV page.

541
01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:37.680
Gerald Glynn: So you know I wanted to be consistency with study across my size, so this is very easy I rush my style of.

542
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:46.890
Lauren Coffey: heroes yeah all just said in the chat there i'm can you just explain how to not lose that work piece.

543
01:34:47.370 --> 01:34:48.120
Gerald Glynn: yeah yeah.

544
01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:49.020
Gerald Glynn: So.

545
01:34:49.110 --> 01:35:08.160
Gerald Glynn: I just really a reiteration now so when I right clicked so originally I just go back into this from step one time, to the question, Paul so come to my page I was doing something with this and heading, so I right clicked on it and I inspected the element.

546
01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:25.380
Gerald Glynn: It shows me the html here on the Left and the Right, it shows me the styles that are being applied to that, so this here is trying to refresh it's just almost like a sandbox that you can you can blame it on you can.

547
01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.180
Gerald Glynn: add anything you want to so margin.

548
01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.340
Gerald Glynn: Top 20 pixels or something a bit more drastic.

549
01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:53.100
Gerald Glynn: So, so the point is this is Nash, in any way connected back to the code that you're writing this is only temporary within here so it's important that.

550
01:35:53.910 --> 01:36:02.820
Gerald Glynn: Any tweaks that you have made in real time in the sandbox that in order once you're happy with them, you need to put them back in your CSS.

551
01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:12.600
Gerald Glynn: and actually new CSS code now I wrote those out one by one, sometimes the CSS block you'd have you've written quite a bit of work.

552
01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:23.010
Gerald Glynn: And, and if i've i've written for things there I should feel nervous name, because this isn't this is transient I need i'm happy with that i've done a piece of work.

553
01:36:23.670 --> 01:36:44.070
Gerald Glynn: It took me a while to do so, rather than typing out one by one another thing you can do is you can actually select with in and within the browser tools, so I selected all the lines, though, and I can right click and copy or compress and commander control C.

554
01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:48.720
Gerald Glynn: And just kind of deletion what I did there.

555
01:36:49.770 --> 01:37:01.710
Gerald Glynn: And fingers crossed I can copy and paste and copy base amazing little bit messy I didn't get the inventing right, so what I can do, there is like an indent itself.

556
01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:09.330
Gerald Glynn: it's debatable indent again is in denting your browser doesn't care about those endings.

557
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.770
Gerald Glynn: Is.

558
01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:31.950
Gerald Glynn: It actually it actively ignores them, so their for their for me to be able to read this now i've put it into side luck and now I can rest of these okay i've taken this copied what I was doing in the browser sandbox Dev tools edge, and now I can feel confident, I can refresh my page.

559
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.780
Gerald Glynn: And, and if I had added and i'm just going to do.

560
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:41.190
Gerald Glynn: A silly one margin left under ish.

561
01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:55.020
Gerald Glynn: To bring us in and so just to reiterate the point and I didn't I didn't copy and paste that into my CSS block so now, when I refresh.

562
01:37:55.470 --> 01:38:05.700
Gerald Glynn: The margin left is lost, so this is a transient em space, so I know you're right Bobby if you want to give me a thumbs up emoji if dash clarifies your question, could you think.

563
01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:20.850
Gerald Glynn: So I am okay Moving on, so I did some really nice work here on heading ones and heading tues I have a heading one heading to on my side here so and.

564
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:27.450
Gerald Glynn: Say Okay, I want to apply those I want to have consistency across my website.

565
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.280
Gerald Glynn: i'm going to apply my new styles into here.

566
01:38:34.530 --> 01:38:35.190
Gerald Glynn: and

567
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.630
Gerald Glynn: And I got to remove this willing to come okay.

568
01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:52.320
Gerald Glynn: Okay i'm gonna be i'm really smart i'm like oh no I don't want to do, I don't have any three, so this is, and this is cold, I do not need so I want to be.

569
01:38:53.550 --> 01:39:06.690
Gerald Glynn: You know, I only want code on the page dash reflects the page and I go to my next page and I gosh a heading one it's just another smaller because i've zoomed out on this one so i'll zoom in.

570
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:20.340
Gerald Glynn: zoom never later so i'm doing into hundreds here just because i'm on a 4k monitor OK cool so I got a heading one heading to pink cool my branding is on.

571
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:29.700
Gerald Glynn: On point what's the problem can anyone think of a why I shouldn't do this.

572
01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:47.580
Gerald Glynn: So i'm just I just don't bring up the two pages, side by side in the am in vs code week to consume.

573
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.010
Gerald Glynn: So.

574
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:53.700
Baptiste Gilistro: So you're asking why.

575
01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:56.850
Baptiste Gilistro: The two pages open next to it.

576
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:19.290
Gerald Glynn: Joe and no so what i'm asking is and i've done I just know the word styling my CV very happy British some of that citing I want on my homepage so like computers into my homepage So why is why is having this block in my homepage and on my CV a bad idea.

577
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:27.240
Gerald Glynn: give everyone a heads.

578
01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:32.730
Gerald Glynn: don't repeat yourself.

579
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:45.510
Gerald Glynn: So now I one day look at my website, I think you know what i'm going to make my headings green, so I go to my homepage I see green.

580
01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:56.460
Gerald Glynn: And i'm happy and then I click on my CV i'm like all it's pink and green here, so now i'm maintaining to style sheets.

581
01:40:57.270 --> 01:41:12.450
Gerald Glynn: But it's one website, I want, there can be a consistent and aesthetic across my website so as we discussed and very before we discuss various ways that CSS can be it can be.

582
01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:27.270
Gerald Glynn: In line so written into the element, it can be embedded and that's what we've done today, and then you remember the third way that we, the third place, that we can keep our style sheets.

583
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:44.850
Gerald Glynn: So we said that we can keep them externally so let's just do a quick and i'm going to do a quick search on CSS and external.

584
01:41:45.930 --> 01:42:01.320
Gerald Glynn: file stern known as to the first one is turn your forehead see that that gives me okay so w three schools again it's a nice I find for the level that we're at the moment it's it's a nice and.

585
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:16.110
Gerald Glynn: it's a good website to go to so some of this is looking familiar, I have a to have dark and then within the head, all I have in my head at the moment is tightening they have this other thing called a link.

586
01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:22.050
Gerald Glynn: And you're going to copy just for the sake of time i'm going to copy and paste dash.

587
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:36.990
Gerald Glynn: So it says link has an attribute and Arielle means like what it relates to the exact different types of links of.

588
01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:57.780
Gerald Glynn: and other content that we want to want to bring into the website so all we're doing is telling the web pages like this is a link to a file somewhere and it's it's it's about the style sheet it's to do with and the style of my website so, and so I need somehow to get the style.

589
01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.550
Gerald Glynn: and

590
01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:09.990
Gerald Glynn: Out of these pages and into a separate resource, so what i'm going to do on my website is i'm going to right click create a folder.

591
01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:24.540
Gerald Glynn: And all i'm doing is just glitch and again so right taking on my website i'm creating a new folder, and this is the first.

592
01:43:25.710 --> 01:43:35.100
Gerald Glynn: A group of assets that we've introduced so i'm just going to kind of create a folder called assets and and then within that i'm going to create a.

593
01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.090
Gerald Glynn: yeah let's just create a file called.

594
01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.390
CSS.

595
01:43:45.150 --> 01:43:49.530
Gerald Glynn: And it opens it up there in vs code so.

596
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:51.720
Gerald Glynn: I want to tell.

597
01:43:53.310 --> 01:44:02.910
Gerald Glynn: This web page to reference this started, so I just in my address double quotes it's an attribute to html.

598
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:12.990
Gerald Glynn: element and then i'm going to vs code review press and full stop or period forward slash.

599
01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:26.790
Gerald Glynn: that's telling this she's, this is a relative URL because I don't know where my website going live, yes, you know I mean when I move it on my machine, so I want to say, full stop forward slash says from this folder.

600
01:44:28.050 --> 01:44:41.550
Gerald Glynn: What where can I go from there and it vs code is very smart It shows me that there's something called assets and with in acids, there is a file called CSS so i'm going to add delete this one.

601
01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:46.980
Gerald Glynn: And i'm now going to.

602
01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:49.140
Gerald Glynn: Take.

603
01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.220
Gerald Glynn: This style and put it in my.

604
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:55.080
CSS.

605
01:44:56.550 --> 01:45:05.250
Gerald Glynn: So am vs code is showing me done this i've done incorrectly on purpose to show you a CSS is our vs codes.

606
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:20.910
Gerald Glynn: And error detection so much I can word if you misspelled word it underlines it and read so vs code and is pretty good at detecting errors so it's it's underlines here.

607
01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:35.130
Gerald Glynn: And it says X room are selector expected already know that mean Bush this looked like it was right, but remember the style tag is html element.

608
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:53.550
Gerald Glynn: Which in which between the opening closing day we put our CSS is a CSS file so there's no but ah man I miss have no business in here so i'm going to remove the style tag you don't need you anymore, and then i'm just going to clean up my inventing.

609
01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:07.950
Gerald Glynn: So just like we discussed so I can select all the texture control a on windows command a on on a MAC and I can endanger that way if I want to end and.

610
01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:18.420
Gerald Glynn: The opposite way I just press shift and tab so, and if you don't have to type or is it usually lives on the left hand side above capsule and it looks like.

611
01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:27.420
Gerald Glynn: flash so whenever I say tab that's the key I mean I know what i'm doing now is pressing shift and tab to.

612
01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:34.680
Gerald Glynn: Do and I leave my CSS commenting as a reminder.

613
01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:49.110
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so I linked this file in my website, I had originally turned green as an example, so if everyone can't plan, when I refresh my.

614
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:53.580
Gerald Glynn: homepage it should have picked up this tells us boom.

615
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.530
Gerald Glynn: and

616
01:46:56.730 --> 01:46:57.510
Gerald Glynn: I have ish.

617
01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.430
Gerald Glynn: left here so i'm going to remove this.

618
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.150
Gerald Glynn: From here now it's going to.

619
01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:18.300
Gerald Glynn: We talked about the cascading nature of style sheets cascading means and a few different things to one really we learned of cascading nature is.

620
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:35.460
Gerald Glynn: The last the last rule is the one that is respected, so you can override simply because it came later within the styling cheese and another room is that.

621
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:39.090
Gerald Glynn: And let's just do something simple here.

622
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.370
Gerald Glynn: i'm going to do is on the heading to.

623
01:47:46.170 --> 01:48:04.140
Gerald Glynn: The other room is the precedence of where this style is the location of the style takes precedence, so I have a style sheet here and i'm going to go to my CV and a comment just temporarily comments deserves.

624
01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:17.940
Gerald Glynn: And refresh oops okay why didn't it work because we don't have our stars you think he's going to copy that link into the head i'm going to put it down.

625
01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:21.540
Gerald Glynn: Tony here.

626
01:48:23.610 --> 01:48:23.820
and

627
01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:35.280
Gerald Glynn: refresh okay I starting is working and, for some reason I want my seat that my h2o is on my CV to be green.

628
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:52.950
Gerald Glynn: It just it's just a page, I wanted to make a lot of to step outside of the binding I agreed, and so one way to do that if it's not about advising series but i'm using this as an example to show this so i'm going to make that heading to green.

629
01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:00.480
Gerald Glynn: Okay.

630
01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:29.550
Gerald Glynn: So it is a broad in the style, so what what this has done is it's brought in the CSS styling for the page as occasion the style sheet and then because this came afterwards is style block.

631
01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:41.910
Gerald Glynn: It overrides and this with green so you can do this, am at a document level and also, I may I have he was here.

632
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.380
Gerald Glynn: Bush, and so I just put up this is.

633
01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.050
Gerald Glynn: and

634
01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:52.860
Gerald Glynn: This is embedded.

635
01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:55.710
Gerald Glynn: In.

636
01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:57.870
Gerald Glynn: CSS.

637
01:50:00.210 --> 01:50:05.310
Gerald Glynn: This isn't, this is a link to external CSS.

638
01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:27.060
Gerald Glynn: And for some reason I may want to apply a different color or any CSS to my first one here, I want to give it some attention, so I can do style equals.

639
01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:28.680
color.

640
01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:30.240
red.

641
01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:38.730
Gerald Glynn: And when we do this, this is called a.

642
01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:50.070
Gerald Glynn: Okay we're coming up to find the hour, so any questions on that.

643
01:50:58.950 --> 01:51:09.570
Gerald Glynn: So at generally, we want to keep all our style sheets out of the html document so we want to keep all our styling here.

644
01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:28.320
Gerald Glynn: And so, if we wanted to achieve what I did here with a different color on a separate page and a different color for the first one, and we have better tools to help us with that and we look at em I just leave ish.

645
01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:45.990
Gerald Glynn: yeah i'll leave it that, so what we what we've been moving on to within CSS is m classing and we introduce classes to our html elements in order to help tell the styling hopes tyler's that's what we'll be looking at next week.

646
01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:52.350
Gerald Glynn: Okay, so am I going to open the assignment backup.

647
01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:17.970
Gerald Glynn: So so stay we covered our styling and CSS so you can get started on your assignment straight away and we didn't we didn't talk about how to link the pages, we did cover links, though, so I just do a quick.

648
01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:33.990
Gerald Glynn: example dash and on the page introducing, whereas it is or perish here is my CV as CV is the text, I want to put on a link.

649
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:55.020
Gerald Glynn: And I can link dash hatred, is the attribute equals two and articles, and I can use just a like requires linking the size is just to put in full stop or period forward slash and I can link that to my CV so.

650
01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.630
Gerald Glynn: Before I had to independent.

651
01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.760
Gerald Glynn: web pages.

652
01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:16.590
Gerald Glynn: But now I have this web pages linked to this is the first step to a website is linking those web pages and so that's something you can do is when, so I would.

653
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:27.180
Gerald Glynn: From today I would start fleshing out your five pages and think about what content, you want to plant them in last semester we teach you rose.

654
01:53:27.690 --> 01:53:51.840
Gerald Glynn: blog posts in Martin So there you go perfect content within that you add images and lists you add institute's a table, and so, if we didn't cover tables day, but I would encourage you to go and and look up some examples on w three schools, so that shouldn't hold you back and.

655
01:53:53.280 --> 01:54:13.260
Gerald Glynn: So get a table, you would have had a table in your proposed Martin so and Stephen get a table and coming together, even if it looks messy just add look at w three schools example and get a table on one of the web pages and what else can you start moving on.

656
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:37.680
Gerald Glynn: so that you can separate and some contact and then and we'll look as forums input forums and next week and and we'll look ash making a contact form on a comment in front of me in front of me okay two minutes to two Okay, so any concerns queries before we wrap up.

657
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:50.250
Baptiste Gilistro: quickly yeah so can we use a you know the last second last decision assignments about is what you told me right, like the the.

658
01:54:51.690 --> 01:54:58.920
Baptiste Gilistro: The website, the blog we made that's a list last session, can we use this as an example to the our websites.

659
01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:04.080
Gerald Glynn: Perfect so last two last semester you wrote a blog post.

660
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:05.610
Gerald Glynn: As investor then yeah.

661
01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.530
Gerald Glynn: You can use, you can use all of that.

662
01:55:07.650 --> 01:55:16.110
Gerald Glynn: I would we use that content, if you want for this at to focus on this assignment isn't so much the content.

663
01:55:16.590 --> 01:55:26.310
Gerald Glynn: And it's more the use of the html elements, so if you want to use that I mean a CV works is a good example because you probably have dash and like you saw it could.

664
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:42.120
Gerald Glynn: Use headings break it down into lists and any other thing that you wanted any other html elements that you think would work plan on your CV and it says in style you've done in word to your CV or other documents see if you can figure out how to replicate bash in html and CSS.

665
01:55:42.630 --> 01:55:43.290
And markup.

666
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:52.320
Baptiste Gilistro: And what about you yeah that will see the aesthetic aesthetic time I guess you know, like it's mostly.

667
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:53.760
Gerald Glynn: focused on just.

668
01:55:53.820 --> 01:56:07.470
Gerald Glynn: just get it there and and you know would be deep will be going deeper into as CSS as so m don't have anything to do with.

669
01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:18.570
Gerald Glynn: Like that that's like the full width web page like into that website I would leave anyway so we're going to be looking ash, you know how we're going to look to make this look like a.

670
01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:21.120
Gerald Glynn: smarter website so everything on our layout.

671
01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:23.070
Gerald Glynn: And in CSS.

672
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:27.180
Baptiste Gilistro: Okay, so if I just keep it simple and then you could say they shall be okay.

673
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:33.570
Gerald Glynn: yeah and feel like I like feel free to jump ahead and start looking ash and.

674
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:40.830
Gerald Glynn: Think about how you might do something that you may want to do, and if you just search em.

675
01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:42.570
Gerald Glynn: w three schools.

676
01:56:42.810 --> 01:56:51.000
Gerald Glynn: seems to always come up now on results so either you can follow into their or even search directly within w three schools and.

677
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:56.250
Gerald Glynn: If you have an idea of something that you want to replicate and you don't know you know you're not going to know what the CSS.

678
01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:06.780
Gerald Glynn: name for that you're not going to know what the html attributes is for those So if you search em there's a quick hack and actually when you search individual skills think.

679
01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:23.610
Gerald Glynn: yeah actually when you search within w three schools it's now its own internal search it's powered by Google so it's the same as if you were to search on Google and if anyone ever wants to touch do this so.

680
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.400
Gerald Glynn: Quick search hack.

681
01:57:27.450 --> 01:57:30.090
Gerald Glynn: If you ever want to search a website for something.

682
01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:37.890
Gerald Glynn: That you can go site colon w three schools, and you can say what do I want to know.

683
01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:40.770
Gerald Glynn: And image.

684
01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:57.420
Gerald Glynn: So, and this works on most search engines, so if you're like me and you want to avoid using Google search, which is what are the three skills such as verify, then you can just use site colon.

685
01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:16.470
Gerald Glynn: Any URL and your search term, and that was search and return search results only from that website so this might be handy is, if you you figured you want to do something and I want to create a table with the header.

686
01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:30.720
Gerald Glynn: You know I don't know what that means what that html tag is was searching just that term issues enter and getting some decent results there, how to create a tab header and then Th tag.

687
01:58:32.010 --> 01:58:34.920
Gerald Glynn: So I want to be i'm not going to be hand holding me.

688
01:58:36.090 --> 01:58:47.850
Gerald Glynn: For the entire course of you know, this is anatomy and put it in place, I want, and at the start, was starting off with baby steps last week, and this week, but eventually you should be.

689
01:58:48.930 --> 01:59:05.610
Gerald Glynn: researching your own nature elements and trying to get them working and researching your own as CSS styling that you want, how you want them to look as much on your own and then using this time and my time to to help debug are em.

690
01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:15.600
Gerald Glynn: You know, maybe, maybe you got something working we don't really understand why it's working let's let's use that as an example and get better content for the past.

691
01:59:16.710 --> 01:59:22.170
Gerald Glynn: And so, a couple of I know we're just kind of overtime, so a couple of things so.

692
01:59:22.590 --> 01:59:31.590
Gerald Glynn: And justin and as class REPS and we have, I am and jess myself as a meeting scheduled for Monday.

693
01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:42.000
Gerald Glynn: So if there are concerns that you're adding you don't want to bring them to me directly and and they're your go tues so i'd encourage you to get in contact.

694
01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:56.250
Gerald Glynn: With them before the weekend and i'm imagining they were 12 noon on Monday and and the other good news is, we have a contract signed for at the road is m.

695
01:59:57.210 --> 02:00:05.520
Gerald Glynn: The road is like technical think it's a technical assistant, is what the contractors so m their role.

696
02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:17.910
Gerald Glynn: within them that's for the masters, overall, so any technical difficulties people run into more around installing software and ebit attash.

697
02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:30.900
Gerald Glynn: So i'm meeting with her tomorrow and myself Eleanor a meeting to discuss in debt was your role is she has a fixed amount of contract areas, so I might do is as the course we're going to be ramping up.

698
02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:43.860
Gerald Glynn: This course more and more so if and if there's a need for connects to support and maybe to go through, something I did a lecture at a more tutorial level.

699
02:00:44.280 --> 02:01:02.040
Gerald Glynn: And that's what we'll have that supports me in place, so I don't want to be using her and hours with supporting students want to one what we'll do is we're trying when we start running into more difficult and aspects of web development we can.

700
02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:12.360
